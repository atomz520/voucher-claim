# voucher-claim

The database runs with `sequelize` and `sqlite3`. `express` framework was used as the backbone of the application. The dev database is stored in the `voucher-claim.sqlite` file in the root directory. 

`faker-js` library was used to generate dummy data simulating database from client.

It is tested to be working on Node v16.15.0

To run the API:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The server runs on port 8088

Postman collection file is also found on root:
